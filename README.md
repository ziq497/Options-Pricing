# Options-Pricing
We present an elegant way of solving the Black-Scholes partial differential equation using numerical methods. We begin by posing the simplest problem of pricing a vanilla European option, whose PDE is explicitly solvable. We apply central, forward, and backward differences covering different orders of precision and sparse matrix TDMA techniques to arrive at the solution. We compare the error for different step-sizes and choose metaparameters that implement the most numerically stable solution. We then proceed to modify the Black-Scholes equation to price early-exercise (American) options, a model whose partial differential equations need not have explicit solutions and use the numerically stable algorithms proposed to solve them.
